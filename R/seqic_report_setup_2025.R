### IOWA SEQIC REPORT PREP 2024 ----------------------------------------------

# This script prepares for the analyses using the `traumar` package v1.2.0
# For the shapefiles, it is assumed that the files are downloaded from
# https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php using the year 2024
# and then utilizing the Counties (and equivalent), States (and equivalent), and
# Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAS) options in the dropdown dialogue to download
# the files manually and put them in the directory used here.

### CALCULATION FACILITIES =====================================================

# Apply rm_bin_summary with dynamic parameters based on sample size
#
# This function:
# - Accepts a dataset with propensity scores and binary outcomes.
# - Checks for insufficient data (n < 2) and returns a 1-row tibble with
#   pre-defined structure filled with NA_real_ values.
# - Otherwise, determines the number of observations in the dataset and
#   sets thresholds and divisors dynamically:
#     - ≤100 rows: thresholds (0.8, 0.9), divisors = 1
#     - 101–200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 1
#     - >200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 3
# - Applies `traumar::rm_bin_summary()` with the appropriate parameters,
#   using `{{ }}` to support unquoted column names.
# - Returns a tibble summarizing binary outcome performance across propensity bins,
#   with optional bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
#
# Used to flexibly summarize performance metrics across variable sample sizes,
# including edge-case handling for very small cohorts.

### DATA MANIPULATION FACILITIES ===============================================

###_____________________________________________________________________________
# Standard output from traumar is in wide format, with separate columns for each
# SEQIC indicator's numerator, denominator, and calculated value (seqic_*).
#
# The following metadata and helper functions facilitate transforming that wide
# output into a long, tidy format that is easier to analyze, visualize, and
# interpret.
#
# Recommended workflow:
# 1. Compute indicators using traumar::seqic_indicator_*() functions.
# 2. Pass the resulting wide-format data to reshape_seqic_indicators()
#    to pivot it into long format with separate rows per indicator.
# 3. Use match_seqic_indicator() to append indicator names and goals
#    by matching on the indicator code.
# 4. Compute comparison service area and trauma facility verification level
# results
# 5. Use format_seqic_comparison() to clean up service area and comparable trauma
# facility verification results
# 6. Join the service area and comparable verified trauma center data to the
# agency-level data to provide a type of benchmark
###_____________________________________________________________________________

# seqic_indicator_names
# A reference data frame containing SEQIC indicator metadata used for mapping,
# labeling, and evaluation of performance metrics. It includes:
#
# Columns:
# - Indicator: Character code identifying each SEQIC indicator (e.g., "1a", "9b_all").
# - Indicator_Name: Descriptive name of the indicator, suitable for labeling or reporting.
# - Goal: Numeric target threshold (if applicable) representing the performance benchmark
#         for the indicator. Values are `NA_real_` where no explicit goal is defined.
#
# This dataset supports automated indicator classification and goal evaluation within
# trauma and EMS quality assurance workflows.

# Reshape SEQIC indicator columns from wide to long format

#

# - Optionally renames columns dynamically using user-defined regex patterns. Uses
# `pivot_longer()` with a regex pattern to split wide-format indicator data into
# long format.
# - Extracts both the value type (numerator, denominator, seqic, lower_ci,
# upper_ci) and the indicator code (e.g., "8", "8_all") into separate
# components.
# - Uses `.value` in `names_to` to spread the value types into columns.
# - Renames `seqic` to `performance` and standardizes `lower_ci` and `upper_ci` to
# `lower ci` and `upper ci` for readability.
#
# Optional renaming parameters (`rename_cols`, `column_pattern`,
# `match_pattern`, `replace_with`) allow users to dynamically standardize
# indicator suffixes (e.g., converting "_8" to "_8_all").

### DATA EXPORT FACILITIES =====================================================

# ---- export_seqic_data ----
# Export SEQIC Indicator Results to CSV by Agency
#
# This function iterates over a vector of agency names and exports SEQIC
# indicator results (from a precomputed results tibble) to individual
# CSV files for each agency. Files are saved in dynamically generated
# subdirectories based on agency name.
#
# Parameters:
# - agency_names: A character vector of agency or facility names. Each name must
#   match values in the `Facility_Name` column of `seqic_results`.
#
# - seqic_results: A data frame or tibble of SEQIC indicator results that
#   includes a `Facility_Name` column used to filter results per agency.
#
# - indicator: A string indicating the indicator group (e.g., "1a_1f",
#   "4a_4b", "all_indicators") to name output files accordingly.
#
# Side Effects:
# - Creates output directories (if not already present) using:
#   `"C:/Users/nfoss0/OneDrive - State of Iowa HHS/Analytics/BEMTS/SEQIC Facility Reports/2024/output/"`
#
# - Writes agency-specific CSV files to the directory with naming convention:
#   `{agency}_{indicator}.csv`
#
# - Logs progress, warnings, and a summary using the `cli` package.
#
# Output:
# - Returns `invisible(NULL)`; primary function is side-effect file export.
#
# Workflow Context:
# - Use this function after calculating and formatting SEQIC results with
#   `traumar::seqic_indicator_*()` and any additional wrangling or annotation.
# - Designed for batch export of customized reports at the agency level.

# we will:
# - examine calendar years 2020-2024 of trauma data
# - ingest data and calculate results by agency and year using the `traumar`
# package
# - send 1 file per indicator to each agency, 1 file for W, M, and Z statistics,
# and 1 file for the RMM statistics
