### IOWA SEQIC REPORT PREP 2024 ----------------------------------------------

# This script prepares for the analyses using the `traumar` package v1.2.0
# For the shapefiles, it is assumed that the files are downloaded from
# https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php using the year 2024
# and then utilizing the Counties (and equivalent), States (and equivalent), and
# Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAS) options in the dropdown dialogue to download
# the files manually and put them in the directory used here.

### CALCULATION FACILITIES =====================================================

# Apply rm_bin_summary with dynamic parameters based on sample size
#
# This function:
# - Accepts a dataset with propensity scores and binary outcomes.
# - Checks for insufficient data (n < 2) and returns a 1-row tibble with
#   pre-defined structure filled with NA_real_ values.
# - Otherwise, determines the number of observations in the dataset and
#   sets thresholds and divisors dynamically:
#     - ≤100 rows: thresholds (0.8, 0.9), divisors = 1
#     - 101–200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 1
#     - >200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 3
# - Applies `traumar::rm_bin_summary()` with the appropriate parameters,
#   using `{{ }}` to support unquoted column names.
# - Returns a tibble summarizing binary outcome performance across propensity bins,
#   with optional bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
#
# Used to flexibly summarize performance metrics across variable sample sizes,
# including edge-case handling for very small cohorts.

### DATA MANIPULATION FACILITIES ===============================================

###_____________________________________________________________________________
# Standard output from traumar is in wide format, with separate columns for each
# SEQIC indicator's numerator, denominator, and calculated value (seqic_*).
#
# The following metadata and helper functions facilitate transforming that wide
# output into a long, tidy format that is easier to analyze, visualize, and
# interpret.
#
# Recommended workflow:
# 1. Compute indicators using traumar::seqic_indicator_*() functions.
# 2. Pass the resulting wide-format data to reshape_seqic_indicators()
#    to pivot it into long format with separate rows per indicator.
# 3. Use match_seqic_indicator() to append indicator names and goals
#    by matching on the indicator code.
# 4. Compute comparison service area and trauma facility verification level
# results
# 5. Use format_seqic_comparison() to clean up service area and comparable trauma
# facility verification results
# 6. Join the service area and comparable verified trauma center data to the
# agency-level data to provide a type of benchmark

# seqic_indicator_names
# A reference data frame containing SEQIC indicator metadata used for mapping,
# labeling, and evaluation of performance metrics. It includes:
#
# Columns:
# - Indicator: Character code identifying each SEQIC indicator (e.g., "1a", "9b_all").
# - Indicator_Name: Descriptive name of the indicator, suitable for labeling or reporting.
# - Goal: Numeric target threshold (if applicable) representing the performance benchmark
#         for the indicator. Values are `NA_real_` where no explicit goal is defined.
#
# This dataset supports automated indicator classification and goal evaluation within
# trauma and EMS quality assurance workflows.

# Reshape SEQIC indicator columns from wide to long format

# - Optionally renames columns dynamically using user-defined regex patterns. Uses
# `pivot_longer()` with a regex pattern to split wide-format indicator data into
# long format.
# - Extracts both the value type (numerator, denominator, seqic, lower_ci,
# upper_ci) and the indicator code (e.g., "8", "8_all") into separate
# components.
# - Uses `.value` in `names_to` to spread the value types into columns.
# - Renames `seqic` to `performance` and standardizes `lower_ci` and `upper_ci` to
# `lower ci` and `upper ci` for readability.
#
# Optional renaming parameters (`rename_cols`, `column_pattern`,
# `match_pattern`, `replace_with`) allow users to dynamically standardize
# indicator suffixes (e.g., converting "_8" to "_8_all").

# send_facility_emails()
#
# Sends individualized emails with attachments to facilities listed in an XLSX

# - Locates the folder of files using a secure base path plus the file folder name
# - Attaches all files found in that folder plus a common guide file
# - Sends an HTML email with a consistent, styled message via Microsoft365R Outlook
# - Logs success/failure for each email to a CSV file
#
# Environment variables used:
#   TPM_CONTACTS - path to XLSX file with contact info
#   FACILITY_PATH - root directory for facility-specific report folders
#   GUIDE_PATH - path to a common guide PDF attached to all emails
#
# Input:
#   recipient_file - path to the XLSX contact file (default: Sys.getenv("TPM_CONTACTS"))

  <p>Dear {tpm},</p>

  <p>
    Attached is your facility’s (<strong>{tcf}</strong>) risk-adjusted mortality metrics and SEQIC (System Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee) performance report for the previous five years (including the target reporting year). The attached files include your center’s performance across all 13 SEQIC indicators and are intended to support your local quality improvement efforts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along with the statistical files, I have also attached a guide to help you navigate the reports. Please use this guide, as it will do a good job of answering most of the questions you will have up front about the statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have questions about any metrics, methodology, or would like technical assistance interpreting the results, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
  </p>

  <p>Thank you for your continued commitment to trauma system improvement in Iowa.</p>

# ---- export_seqic_data ----
# Export SEQIC Indicator Results to CSV by Agency
#
# This function iterates over a vector of agency names and exports SEQIC
# indicator results (from a precomputed results tibble) to individual
# CSV files for each agency. Files are saved in dynamically generated
# subdirectories based on agency name.
#
# Parameters:
# - agency_names: A character vector of agency or facility names. Each name must
#   match values in the `Facility_Name` column of `seqic_results`.
#
# - seqic_results: A data frame or tibble of SEQIC indicator results that
#   includes a `Facility_Name` column used to filter results per agency.
#
# - indicator: A string indicating the indicator group (e.g., "1a_1f",
#   "4a_4b", "all_indicators") to name output files accordingly.
#
# Side Effects:
# - Creates output directories (if not already present) using:
#   `"C:/Users/nfoss0/OneDrive - State of Iowa HHS/Analytics/BEMTS/SEQIC Facility Reports/2024/output/"`
#
# - Writes agency-specific CSV files to the directory with naming convention:
#   `{agency}_{indicator}.csv`
#
# - Logs progress, warnings, and a summary using the `cli` package.
#
# Output:
# - Returns `invisible(NULL)`; primary function is side-effect file export.
#
# Workflow Context:
# - Use this function after calculating and formatting SEQIC results with
#   `traumar::seqic_indicator_*()` and any additional wrangling or annotation.
# - Designed for batch export of customized reports at the agency level.
